The program consists of two main functions: mergeSort() and merge().    The mergeSort() function is a recursive function that is used to divide the array    into smaller sub-arrays, sort each sub-array, and then merge the sorted subarrays back    together. It takes three arguments:array: The array to be sortedstart: The starting index of the portion of the array to be sortedend: The ending index of the portion of the array to be sortedThe function first checks if the start index is less than the end index,which indicates that there are still elements to be sorted. If this is the case,it calculates the midpoint of the portion of the array to be sorted and calls itselfrecursively on the left and right halves of the array. Once both halves have beensorted, the function calls the merge() function to merge the sorted halves back together.The merge() function is used to merge two sorted sub-arrays into a singlesorted array. It takes four arguments:array: The original arraystart: The starting index of the first sub-arraymid: The ending index of the first sub-array and the starting index of the second subarrayend: The ending index of the second sub-arrayThe function first creates a temporary array to store the merged elements.It then initializes three variables: leftIndex, rightIndex, and tempIndex,which are used to track the current indices of the elements being comparedin the left and right sub-arrays and the temporary array, respectively.The function then enters a loop that compares the elements at the currentindices of the left and right sub-arrays, and adds the smaller of the twoelements to the temporary array. It increments the index of the sub-arrayfrom which the element was taken and the index of the temporary array. Thiscontinues until either the left or right sub-array has been completely traversed.After the loop finishes, the function checks if there are any remaining elementsin the left or right sub-array and adds them to the temporary array. Finally, itcopies the elements from the temporary array back into the original array.The main() function creates an array of integers, prints it out, and then callsthe mergeSort() function to sort it. It then prints the sorted array.* */// Time complexity explanations/** The mergeSort() function has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)).* This is because, in the worst case, the function needs to divide* the array into sub-arrays and sort each sub-array, which takes O(log(n)) time.* It then needs to merge the sorted sub-arrays back together, which takes O(n) time.* Since these two operations are performed repeatedly until the entire array is sorted,* the overall time complexity is O(nlog(n)).The time complexity of the mergeSort() function is based on the assumption that the merge()* function has a time complexity of O(n). If the merge() function had a lower time complexity* (such as O(log(n))), the overall time complexity of the mergeSort() function would also be lower.It's worth noting that the time complexity of the mergeSort() function is based on* the worst-case scenario, where the array is randomly ordered and needs to be completely* sorted. In practice, the time complexity may be lower if the array is partially sorted or* has certain characteristics (such as many repeated elements) that make it easier to sort.*/
